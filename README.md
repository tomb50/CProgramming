CProgramming
============

This is a repository purely to store old course assignments written in C over the past few years whilst studying
at University, from introductory level (270) to collaborative assignments (390) and part of a final year Astrophysics
project (319).

Having had no programming experience prior to these assignments, it is likely that some of the programs contain logical
errors or potential bugs and should not taken as model implementations.
