CProgramming
============

This is personaly/learning repository to store old course assignments written in C over the past few years whilst 
at University, from introductory level (270) to collaborative assignments (390) and part of a final year project.

It is likely that some of the programs may contain logical errors and bugs so if you anyone wishes to use them 
or extend the programs I would strongly suggest cross referencing the results with seperate method.
